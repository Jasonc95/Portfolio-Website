        <h2 id="About-Me">About Me</h2> 
        <p>Hello there, I'm Jason Clough, a beginner front-end developer from England with big dreams of one day becoming the best developer I can be. I'm also a huge fan of traveling and exploring new places, meeting new people, and immersing myself in diverse cultures. and just living my best life. Some of my hobbies involve.<br><br>
            
             <b>- staying active and healthy -</b><br>
             I'm a firm believer in the saying "healthy body, healthy mind".
             I love to swimming in the ocean with my snorkel, diving down amongst schools of fish and soaking in peacefulness of the underwater world.<br> I also go to the gym, I find it helps me maintain a healthy mindset as im often pushing my limits. <br><br>

             <b>- Being Creative and Learning -</b><br>
             I'm a curious soul, and I'm always eager to expand my horizons. So instead of watching TV or getting stuck in to a good Netflix series I'm usually on the internet researching new topics and picking up various skills. From learning graphic design or tinkering with Unreal Engine to building shelters and starting fires with sticks - I'm always up for a challenge.<br><br>

             <b> - Gaming -</b><br>
             Of course, gaming. Although I'm more than fond of the outdoors you will catch me gaming from time to time, because I travel its a great way for me to stay connected and somewhat social with my friends. My favourite game I play is Rocket League seconded by Call of Duty.
